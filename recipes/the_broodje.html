    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        To make a ham and truffle sandwich, begin by toasting two slices of your favorite bread to add texture. Once toasted, spread a generous amount of Kewpie mayo on one side of each slice, infusing a rich, umami flavor. Lay ham slices on one piece of bread, adjusting the quantity to your liking. Add truffle cheese, either in slices or grated, atop the ham to introduce a luxurious, aromatic taste. Close the sandwich with the other slice of bread, mayo side facing inwards. Optionally, you can briefly grill the sandwich to melt the cheese and meld the flavors. Once ready, serve the sandwich immediately, enjoying the gourmet blend of ham and truffle cheese in this simple yet elegant meal.
